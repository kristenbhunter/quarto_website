# PUMP

The PUMP R package allows a user to estimate power for multi-level experiments with multiple outcomes.
The package extends existing power calculation software to take into account multiple testing adjustments (such as Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments, among others).
It also estimates minimum detectable effect size (MDES) and sample size requirements.
