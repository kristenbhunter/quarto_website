# Research expertise and interest

My methodological expertise mainly lies is in causal inference: the design and analysis of experiments and observational studies.
I am also interested in applied Bayesian analysis and statistical software.
Applications of my research have included healthcare, genetics, education, energy, and basic science.

My future research agenda is to apply causal inference methods to problems in environmental science and climate change.
I am actively seeking projects in this area.
If you would like to collaborate, please reach out.
I am eager to work with both quantitative researchers and scientists, engineers, or policy makers who have problems where I can contribute statistical expertise.
