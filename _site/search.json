I am also interested in applied Bayesian analysis and statistical software. Applications of my research have included healthcare, genetics, education, energy, and basic science.\nMy future research agenda is to apply causal inference methods to problems in environmental science, policy, and climate change. I am actively seeking projects in this area. If you would like to collaborate, please reach out. I am eager to work with quantitative researchers, scientists, engineers, policy makers, or others who have problems where I can contribute statistical expertise.\n\n\nWorks in progress\n\nD. Hsu, K.

The package extends existing power calculation software to take into account multiple testing adjustments (such as Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments, among others). It also estimates minimum detectable effect size (MDES) and sample size requirements.\nMore information:\n\nPUMP is available on CRAN. The CRAN site contains vignettes on using the package.\nFor source code and further details, see the github site.\nFor a full package description, including a detailed technical appendix, see arXiv.\nFor users not familiar with R, see the shiny app\nFor a presentation about PUMP, see these slides."
